## Technologies Used

## Description

A C# based MVC webapp serving as a data tracker for a bakery, to allow the manager to view and manage available treats and flavors when logged in, and allows anonymous used to view. Backed by a MySQL database for data persistence.


### Setup Instructions

1. Ensure your computer has the appropriate .NET SDK found [here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0) installed.  
2. Clone this repo.
3. Make a file named 'appsettings.json' within the 'PierresTreats' directory.
4. Within appsettings.json, put in the following code, replacing the bracketed fields with your own values. 
`{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
      "DefaultConnection": "Server=localhost;Port=3306;database=[databaseName];uid=[userName];pwd=[password];"
  }
}`
5. Open your terminal (e.g., Terminal or GitBash) and navigate to this project's production directory called "PierresTreats".
6. In the command line, run the command "dotnet run" to compile and execute the application. Your default browser should automatically open a tab at the address 'https://localhost:5001/', but you may do so manually as well.
7. If your connection is refused, you may fix this by either clicking the 'advanced' button that accompanies the refuesed message, then click 'connect anyway', or you can trust the security certificate by running the terminal command 'dotnet dev-certs https --trust'.
8. Optionally, you can run "dotnet build" to compile this console app without running it.
